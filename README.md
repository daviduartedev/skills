# Skills BY: World's Okayest Software Developer (It's a joke)

Four agent skills I actually run. Small, composable, and meant to sit in a spec-driven loop rather than replace it. They work with any model. Fork them. Make them yours.

## The skills

Four skills, two categories. Agent process lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. This README does not repeat it.

### Security

Work that asks how a change can be abused, checks the finished code against that, and can restate the result for a non-specialist.

- **[security-design-review](./skills/security-design-review/SKILL.md)**: Run **before the spec** is finalised. The agent grounds in the consumer repo, keeps only credible abuse paths (`THREAT-*`), and writes implementation-independent `SEC-*` invariants to `docs/security/<feature-slug>.md`. [Human guide](docs/engineering/security-design-review.md)
- **[security-review](./skills/security-review/SKILL.md)**: Run **after implement**, against a **fixed point** (diff, branch, PR, or named scope). Publishes evidenced `SR-*` findings in the conversation. When `SEC-*` exist, records PASS or FAIL on that same file. [Human guide](docs/engineering/security-review.md)

They are a pair: design review produces requirements; implementation review checks the diff and those requirements. OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 is applied **by relevance** (`v5.0.0-X.X.X`); requirement bodies are not copied.

- **[teach-me-sec](./skills/teach-me-sec/SKILL.md)**: Run **when you want a non-specialist explanation** of a design-review or security-review. Restates that output in working literacy (`docs/security/<feature-slug>-explained.md` plus the conversation). It does not add findings. [Human guide](docs/engineering/teach-me-sec.md)

### Delivery

Work that puts the change in front of a human before it is treated as done.

- **[dvd-tests](./skills/dvd-tests/SKILL.md)**: Run **after implement**, before commits. Starts the implementation branch locally on a **free port** when a UI exists, **Drives** that UI in a browser, prints E2E results, then an unchecked checklist of what you can see or do (including a relevant negative check), and waits. Login profiles come from your docs or from you, never invented. This run does not commit. Former name: `smoke-test-list`. [Human guide](docs/engineering/dvd-tests.md)

Everything in this collection is **model-invoked**: you can type the name, or the agent can reach for it when the slot matches.

## Installation

Two ways in. **The plugin manifests in this repo** install the set as a bundle. **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh/daviduartedev/skills)** copies editable skill files into your project. Pick one: installing both leaves you with every skill twice.

**Claude Code**

The plugin lives in [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json). From a clone, add this repository as a plugin; the plugin discovers `skills/`.

**Codex, Cursor, and other agents**

```bash
npx skills add daviduartedev/skills --all
```

`npx skills add daviduartedev/skills` also works; `--all` installs all four skills without picking them one by one.

**For tinkerers**

Use the same installer. It writes the skills into your repo as ordinary files you own. Pull later changes with `npx skills update`.

Layout: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

- **Claude Code:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- **Cursor:** `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` with `"skills": "./skills/"`
